    <div class="project_text"> <p>Mathematical literacy of the <i>non</i>-euclidean, <i>non</i>linear, and <i>non</i>analytic world is essential to describing anything interesting. However, the math taught in school spanning from pre-K to twelfth grade merely teaches one how to count in clever ways: basic set theory, functions, calculus, etc.. It is akin to the ABC’s of math, and most will never go on to learn how to utter an intriguing sentence. The reason we put <i>non</i> as a prefix in the first place is simply because they are taught secondarily. While most won’t pursue a degree in mathematics, one may expand their literacy of the <i>non</i>-world by asking themselves a few simple questions.</p>
<h3>Where does an object live, and what about its surface?</h3>
<p>Visually, when one looks at something they are viewing in a “space”. The space we find most intuitive is flat space, known as Euclidean Space, which uses Cartesian Coordinates (ordered pair of perpendicular values). The geometry of objects we see around us like a car or an apple seem to fit perfectly into this space, so do most algebraic relationships, therefore we often throw points onto a Euclidean space without thinking too much about it. But as we widen our horizon, literally, we can see that if we travel along Earth’s surface we will end up at our starting point. Now, it becomes clear that Euclidean space was never the universal describer, let alone the world describer. A coordinate system that loops upon itself is necessary, hence Spherical Coordinates. However, let’s say one did not care to investigate new coordinate systems. If one tried to plot the Earth’s surface using Euclidean space, one would find that the Earth is infinite, and seems to repeat itself periodically on every axis! If that wasn’t already a sign that the coordinate system was suspicious, try explaining diminishing latitudes and longitudes everytime one moves one’s frame of reference. In general, for every object there is a global space and a local space. Earth can be described as a ball in Euclidean space, however its surface is non-Euclidean. Noticing the local and global spaces of objects around us are essential to improving our understanding of the world at large. Maybe it would reduce the neurosis of flat-Earth conspiracies if we taught this from the get-go.</p>
<h3>What points of my object should I plot, what's the relationship, and what are the implications?</h3>
<p>When looking at a complex system such as the ocean, one can’t model to perfection. We are limited to our measurements, we can’t simply account for every atom in the pool. For instance, we can log the waves that crash against the shore, the height of the water relative to the ocean floor, or the convection currents between different seas. It is all a matter of what one intends to study. After plotting successfully, the calculus, series, functions, and recursions reveal themselves with some analysis. It is important to not simply discover these relationships, but to classify them mathematically. Are the solutions analytic? Are they chaotic? Nonlinear relationships lead to chaos, which is why nothing in the real world is predictable past a few iterations of applying the same rule. A single inconveniently placed transcendental term can render an algebra insoluble through analytic methods. If we try to approximate to make our equations analytic, what will the new domain restrictions be on the accuracy of the model? These are the trials and tribulations of daring to model the real world. Afterall, without <i>non</i> we cannot exist. The bravery to indulge the non-world manifests as the fruitful discoveries that aid humanity to navigate the real world.</p>

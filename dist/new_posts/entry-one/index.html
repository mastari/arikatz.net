      <h1>Opportunity to connect</h1>
<p><strong>Ari is especially interested in GTM, SDR/BDR, SMB AE, or Sales Engineer roles at an AI company in SF.</strong> (as of January 1, 2026)</p>
<h1>About Ari</h1>
<p>Ari is a developer, educator, and trusted communicator. Raised in Mill Valley, California, Ari began coding in third grade. That early curiosity soon expanded beyond software to questions about the underlying “code of the universe,” leading Ari to study physics throughout high school.</p>
<p>In 2021, Ari was a finalist in the International Breakthrough Junior Challenge, competing against more than 3,400 applicants from 202 countries for a $400,000 prize. The challenge centered on explaining advanced physics concepts to a global audience with clarity and accessibility—an area that has become central to Ari’s work.</p>
<p>In 2022, Ari continued studying physics at the University of California, Berkeley, while also shipping software and applications for businesses. Most notably, Ari developed the mobile news app for a journal read by millions, <em><a href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a></em>.</p>
<p>Today, Ari is graduated and searching for a long term role at an AI company in SF that leverages his technical understanding and clear communication, <strong>determined to push an AI company with ambitious goals to new heights.</strong></p>
<p>If you are hiring, Ari is available to reach below to discuss mutual opportunities.</p>

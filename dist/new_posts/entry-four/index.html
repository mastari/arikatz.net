      <h1>ROI begins with ROP</h1>
<p>Increasing ROI starts with paying attention to ROP. What is ROP? It's <em>return on prompt</em>.</p>
<p>In a gold rush economy, everyone is looking to buy a pickaxe. After all, there are gold in these mines! But after people take off the gold colored glasses, they realize that they are spending too much on pickaxes and not mining enough gold. They start thinking about ROP, <em>return on pickaxe</em>.</p>
<p>Prompts are pickaxes of today, and while most people started their AI journey with OpenAI or Google's products, after scaling they are often paying way more than they need to solve the narrow task they used the model for.</p>
<p>There are many startups offering to shrink models for businesses, and often they are sitting on the backs of a handful of papers and open source models hosted on HuggingFace.</p>
<h2>Everyone Already Heard That Analogy</h2>
<p>Analogies to describe the problem are useless, because we already see this happening all around us. But analogies to describe solutions, and <em>bring clarity</em>, are in demand.</p>
<p>Here is mine: AI is at the heart of every business. So we need to size that heart properly.</p>
<p>In Biology, Heart size and optimal organism function and longevity are related. Swap the heart of a hummingbird with that of a whale and you get complications.</p>
<p>The Whale heart is too big and powerful and slow for the hummingbird. And the humming bird heart is too weak and fast for the whale.</p>
<p>These days, since AI is at the heart of all our businesses, we need to reflect on this heart.</p>
<p>Most people plug in the heart of OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude Sonnet. However, these hearts are huge. And most people are using these hearts to flap the wings of a hummingbird.</p>

      <h1>ROI begins with ROP</h1>
<p>Increasing ROI starts with paying attention to ROP. What is ROP? It's <em>return on prompt</em>.</p>
<p>In a gold rush economy, everyone is looking to buy a pickaxe. After all, there are gold in these mines! But after people take off the gold colored glasses, they realize that they are spending too much on pickaxes and not mining enough gold. They start thinking about ROP, <em>return on pickaxe</em>.</p>
<p>Prompts are pickaxes of today, and while most people started their AI journey with OpenAI or Google's products, after scaling they are often paying way more than they need to solve the narrow task they used the model for.</p>
<p>There are many startups offering to shrink models for businesses, and often they are sitting on the backs of a handful of papers and open source models hosted on HuggingFace.</p>
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>Businesses are paying more for diminishing ROP.</p>
<p>Then they need options to have 24/7 ROP analysis as AI evolves.</p>
<p>They should offer bounties for reducing costs.</p>
<h2>Missing Solution</h2>
<p>API to hot-swap models.</p>
<p>Staged rollout testing.</p>
<h2>Business Model</h2>
<p>Charge monthly for AI model analysis and take 10% of bounties.</p>

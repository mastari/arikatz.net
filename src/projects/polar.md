<strong>Claim</strong>: A coordinate system is a transformation about some unit vectors. Given an ordered set $P$, the elements $p_1, p_2, ... ,p_n$ are used for directions and/or magnitudes in the space $R_n$.<br/>
<strong>Example</strong>: For example in two-dimensional euclidean space we have translation and rotation, two sides of the same coin; transformation without preserving distance, or with preserving distance (about a pivot). We can either define our coordiante system to be a vector of magnitude and direction, or of magnitudes of two fixed directions (orthagonally or skewed).

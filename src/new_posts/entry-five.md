# Mixing Colors 

The legend of green plus red.

You go back and think in your head.

Painting green and red made brown!

Yet, when I set the R and the G to 253, a true yellow I see!

So what's going on here?

A tale of emission and absorption.

This is the source of our distortion.

A black shirt is hot in the sun, absorbing the electromagnetic fun.

A black pixel is off, because it's emitting no crests and no troughs.

So when paint goes to mix, the absorption graphs share ticks.

And reflect remaining waves that pass through the bricks!

As for light in superposition, the combined waves model addition!

So next time you deal with vision, whether LED or material collision, you will have a framework to answer with precision!

### 1. A New Chapter
I’m currently listening to cafe jazz in my dorm room reflecting upon the fact I’m turning 20 this year. While I believe it is in fact a major milestone, I’m also feeling indifferent to my age. I’ve studied enough math to know 20 is only significant to those who worship the base ten system. I’m more of a mindless follower than a worshiper, so I guess I’m not too phased by the ten’s place changing. There are far too many things to be grateful for to get bogged down about being one year away from legal adulthood. Oh, that sounds worse when I say that out loud.<br/><br/>

### 2. Ten Second Realizations
Lately, I’ve been fascinated about how the brain makes decisions subconsciously up to ten seconds before our conscious pretends it came up with it by itself. I’m honestly upset that the neurologists kept this a secret from me for so long. If I could tap into my subconscious to know what I’m going to do before I do it, I could 10x my productivity. Think about how incredible this is. I’ll give you ten seconds to fully realize it.

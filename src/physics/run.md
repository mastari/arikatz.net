I started a running log. I know lots of people use Strava to share there runs, however I like to make logging my run a part of my routine so instead I've linked a spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfn-tMbpOopps2eamwus7MISBFM4AovIypaxSzKO04k/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a> so you can check my progress.
<br><br>
UPDATE: While my running habit was nearly stellar from the time I made this post to the end of finals, my logging habits were lacking. I don't want to risk an app taking my
job as logger, so I will try again with a new strategy. Instead of simply logging my run
after it has completed, I will set a goal for the run of the day based off of my last
best run, and try to approach it with all my courage. This way, the run incentivizes logging since it is a crucial part of tomorrows run as well. Also, to remind me that this log exists, I'll start adding photos of my favorite run moments.
<br><br>
With 2023 coming to a close, I'd like to mention that I will need to create a new page in the run log. I wasn't happy with my current logging system, and this year runs will be entered using a newly devised method: run time, place, and photos.

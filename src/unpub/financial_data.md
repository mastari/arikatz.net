We begin today's journey in fourth century B.C.E where Plato almost lost his marbles thinking about thinking. Dogged by the division between conceptual and physical reality, Plato came up with this:

> According to this (his) theory, ideas in this sense, often capitalized and translated as "Ideas" or "Forms",[5] are the non-physical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. (Wikipedia)

Now before I morally reject his idea, let's get one thing straight. I'm not a physicalist because I'm a physicist. I'm a physicist because I'm a physicalist. The reason? It's not because I was raised in a cult, or studied verses written by ancient intoxicated poets. It was because ever since I was born, the world had communicated with me directly through my senses. No analysis. Just feels, tastes, sights, sounds, and scents. The ideas? They were just chain reactions of those stimuli. With Plato's theory of forms, I could never get behind the distinction between the physical and non-physical. Nonetheless, I happen to agree that there is a more abstract distinction.

### Mapping Manifolds

Some chairs are made of woody atoms, others are made of neurochemistry. The real chair isn't one or the other, it's the mapping function that translates between the two that is important. What do I mean? Take a look at this one dimensional closed manifold:

I call it: a circle. I can represent it implicitly, polarly, and topologically. The statement "which one is the truest circle?" has simply has no physical meaning.

Implicit:
(make clear that it is represented with two parameters)

Polar:
(1 parameter, but in polar space. but not satisfactory since the countour of the circle appears to be one dimensional path, and therefore should be able to be represented by a flat number line)

Topological:
(1 parameter, in euclidean space. but requires multiple maps to include both polls!)

In each case, we use a unique coordinate functions to represent the same manifold. It's akin to using a flat map to find your way around the spherical Earth. Or if you are a weirdo, using a globe to navigate a flat Earth... The theme I am eluding to is called a "bijection," a function that has an inverse.

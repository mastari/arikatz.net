    <div class="project_text"> <p>What is the <i>rate of change</i>? We are introduced to this concept early in math, but the phrase itself is redundant and tells nothing about its utility. After all, every change has a rate. Utility comes from finding the rate between rates and the rates of rates.  The “change” merely implies a nonzero rate. However, what makes a zero rate depends on what is considered no change. If two cars are moving five meters a second in parallel, then their respective velocity is zero; yet five meters a second relative to the ground. If you buy an egg from your own farm, your transaction costs zero dollars ($1 out, $1 in); yet you just spent a dollar, while also making one back. Rates then, must be understood in their reflexive and relative contexts. Relative rates are responsible for speeding tickets, jealousy, and injuries; the <i>zero rate</i> in these scenarios is about <strong>equilibrium</strong>. Reflexive rates are responsible for conservation of energy, loving relationships, and thriving ecosystems; here the <i>zero rate</i> can be the difference between <strong>an open or closed system</strong>. The wider the domain of rates you consider, the more accurate your description of a system becomes. The beauty of rates is their abstract and tangible purity. I’m not sure how to expand upon this idea in a paper, nor would I claim to have the mathematical maturity to do so. However, I hope this ditty of a passage gives you the inspiration to ponder rates this Valentine's Day!</p>
